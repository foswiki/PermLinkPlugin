---++ Documentation

---+++ Terminology
The %WEB%.%TOPIC% knows two types of identifiers (IDs) to permanently point to a single topic:
   * *md5:* 32 chars long, a hexadecimal number calculated with a standard MD5 hash algorithm based on the original topic name and a timestamp
   * *human:* a human readable version based on the original web and topic name and optionally extended with a timestamp (in seconds)

---+++ ID deployment
On a fresh install (or on a system prior to the installation of this plugin) none of the topics carry an ID. Once the plugin is
activated newly created topics as well as topics which go through an edit-save-cycle automatically get an ID. If you execute
=%<nop>PERMLINK%= on a topic with no ID, you get a warning message. In that case just go through a normal edit-save-cycle.

If you are an administrator you can mass deploy IDs on a web basis. Copy the following URL into your browser and add alter the web
parameter =Foo= to the webname you want to deploy IDs in.
<pre>
%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/%TOPIC%/deploy?web=Foo
</pre>
%X% *CAUTION: This will alter all topic in that web. Be aware, that the "last modified" timestamp and author will be touched!*

---+++ Revision specific permanent links
Permanent links can point to a specific revision of a topic or to the last revision (whatever that is). Revision specific links
end in two hyphens (--) and a number (corresponding to the resivion number). If this suffix is omitted, the link will always
lead to the latest revision. You can add this suffix by adding a =$rev= directly behind the =$md5= or =$human= in the
=%<nop>PERMLINK%= format option.


---++ (Skin) Installation Instructions
This plugin is SKIN agnostic. It does not know anything about your SKIN. If you want to integrate this feature into your SKIN,
you have to manually edit the template files or customisation topics of your SKIN. Just put a =%<nop>PERMLINK{}%= where you
think it fits most.

---++ Authentication Requirements
%WEB%.%TOPIC% uses the Foswiki API to specify that the =deploy= action requires an authenticated user, whereas the =view= action 
(used when following a permanent link) should not.

In order for %WEB%.%TOPIC% to resolve permanent links for guest users, the =rest= script should be removed from ={AuthScripts}= in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]].
   * Foswiki 1.0.x: Turn on expert settings ("Yes, I have read all the documentation"). ={AuthScripts}= is under "Security Setup: Authentication"
   * Foswiki 1.1.x: ={AuthScripts}= is under "User Logins" -&gt; "Login"

---++ Developer notes
The IDs are stored in local PREFerences called =PERM_ID_MD5= and =PERM_ID_HUMAN=.
